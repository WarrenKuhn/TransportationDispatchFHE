# Anonymous Transport Scheduler

## Privacy-First Logistics Optimization with Fully Homomorphic Encryption

A revolutionary decentralized application that enables secure, privacy-preserving transportation scheduling and logistics optimization using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology.

## üîí Core Concepts

### FHE Contract Anonymous Transport Scheduling

This project implements a cutting-edge privacy logistics optimization system that allows transportation carriers and cargo requesters to coordinate efficiently while keeping all sensitive data encrypted throughout the entire process.

**Key Privacy Features:**
- **Encrypted Coordinates**: All pickup and delivery locations remain hidden using FHE
- **Private Capacity Data**: Vehicle capacities and cargo weights are encrypted
- **Anonymous Matching**: Route optimization occurs on encrypted data without revealing details
- **Confidential Pricing**: Maximum costs and pricing information stay private

### How It Works

1. **Route Registration**: Carriers register their transport routes with encrypted start/end coordinates, capacity, and priority levels
2. **Request Submission**: Users submit transport requests with encrypted pickup/drop locations, weight, and maximum cost
3. **Private Optimization**: The system performs route optimization calculations on encrypted data using FHE operations
4. **Anonymous Matching**: Compatible requests are matched to routes without exposing sensitive information

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Functions

**Core Operations:**
- `registerRoute()` - Register encrypted transport routes
- `submitTransportRequest()` - Submit encrypted cargo requests
- `optimizeSchedule()` - Perform FHE-based route optimization
- `matchRequest()` - Anonymous request-to-route matching

**Data Retrieval:**
